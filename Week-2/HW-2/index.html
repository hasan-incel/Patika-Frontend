    <h2>Biography</h2>
    <p>William Shakespeare was born in 1564 in Stratford-upon-Avon, England. He is widely regarded as the greatest playwright of all time and is often called England's national poet. Shakespeare's works, including 39 plays, 154 sonnets, and numerous other poems, have had a profound influence on literature and the English language.</p>
    <p>Shakespeare's early life remains somewhat mysterious, but it is believed that he attended grammar school in Stratford, where he would have studied Latin and classical literature. At the age of 18, he married Anne Hathaway, and they had three children together.</p>
    <p>In the late 1580s, Shakespeare moved to London, where he became involved in the theater scene. He joined the Lord Chamberlain's Men, a renowned acting company, and quickly gained a reputation for his exceptional writing and acting skills. His plays were performed in major theaters, including the famous Globe Theatre.</p>
    <p>Shakespeare's writing spans a range of genres, from tragic plays like <em>"Hamlet"</em>, <em>"Macbeth"</em>, and <em>"Othello"</em> to comedies such as <em>"A Midsummer Night's Dream"</em> and <em>"Twelfth Night"</em>. His historical plays, including <em>"Richard III"</em> and <em>"Henry V"</em>, explored the complexities of power, politics, and human nature.</p>
    <p>His works often delve into themes such as love, betrayal, ambition, and the human condition, making them timeless and universally relatable. Shakespeare's remarkable ability to capture the essence of human emotions and social issues through vivid characters and intricate plots is a hallmark of his writing.</p>
    <p>Shakespeare retired to Stratford around 1613, where he continued to live until his death in 1616. His legacy as a playwright, poet, and storyteller endures today, and his influence on literature, theater, and language is immeasurable.</p>
